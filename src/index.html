            <span class="font-bold italic text-blue-600"
              >powerful CSS framework </span
            >that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes that can be used to
            quickly and easily style HTML elements. The framework is designed to

          <p class="my-4">
            One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
            consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
            can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
            ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
            <span> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="my-4">
            Examples of such utility classes includes the
            <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to
            center align text, while the
            <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to
            add a light gray background color to an element.
          </p>
          <p class="my-4 bg-gradient-to-b from-green-400 to-blue-500">

            powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes consistency in
            design and makes it easy to create responsive designs.
